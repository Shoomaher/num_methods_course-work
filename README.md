# This is my "course work" for numerical methods subject  

I had to implement half-division method implementation using Python and create app with gui.  
Same task was about spline processing: I had to implement interpolation tool using Hermites spline method.  

**Used tools:**

- GUI: tkinter and ttk
- Math expressions: sympy
- Interpolation: scipy
- Plot: matplotlib
